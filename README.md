# Global PV-TE Data Repository

This repository contains solar photovoltaic-thermoelectric (PV-TE) system power and efficiency data for seven countries, representing the seven continents of the world. The data spans a three-year period (2019-2021) and is used for the learning phase (`cleaned_learning_data`). Additionally, daily performance data for 2022 is provided for the forecasting phase (`cleaned_forecasting_data`).

The data has been obtained through experimentally validated numerical simulations using the ANSYS finite element solver software. The dataset covers various geographical locations and weather conditions, offering a comprehensive insight into the performance of PV-TE systems globally.

The nomenclature of the data is provided as follows:

G - Solar irradiance
v - Wind speed
Ta - Air temperature
P_PV-TE - PV-TE power output
N_PV-TE - PV-TE efficiency
